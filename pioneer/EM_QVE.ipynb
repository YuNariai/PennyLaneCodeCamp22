    "500 points\n",
    "At this point, you've been exposed to modelling noise in a quantum circuit and how to amplify a circuit's noise via global circuit folding. In this challenge, you will pioneer a way to perform an error-mitigated version of a quintessential quantum algorithm on noisy hardware!\n",
    "\n",
    "The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm is an elegant optimization algorithm that estimates the ground state and ground state energy of a Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian could describe anything, so long as there's an efficient map to mapping the degrees of freedom to binary variables. Here, we'll use the qubit representation of the molecular hydrogen Hamiltonian. Go check out our popular demo on performing VQE with this Hamiltonian!\n",

    "hydrogen_hamiltonian: this function creates the Hamiltonian describing the H molecule given a hydrogen-to-hydrogen distance d.\n",
    "ansatz_template: this is a quantum function that defines the ansatz for all VQE routines that you will perform.\n",
    "VQE: this function performs a VQE routine given a QNode that you created with qnode_ansatzes.\n",
    "qnode_ansatzes: employs ansatz_template to create QNodes given different devices: an ideal device (no noise) and \"mitigated\" devices that are global-circuit-folding transformed devices. You must complete this function.\n",
    "extrapolation: this is where the magic happens; all VQE routines run, and then the zero-noise extrapolation takes place. You must complete this function.\n",
    "The three error-ridden VQE routines that you perform are tied to three different scale factors. The scale factors define the global circuit folding procedure, and more information can be found in the documentation for qml.transforms.fold_global. When you perform the extrapolation, you will be fitting a second-degree polynomial function (a quadratic function) to VQE energies versus scale factors.\n",

    "\n",
    "If your solution matches the correct one within the given tolerance specified in check (in this case it's a 0.01 relative error tolerance), the output will be \"Correct!\". Otherwise, you will receive a \"Wrong answer\" prompt."
